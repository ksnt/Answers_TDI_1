## Q1.What is the mean of your total payment for N=10?

How to provide an answer to the question:<br>
Computational complexity when using brute force is 3628800, i.e., O(10^6), therefore, we can compute directly<br><br>

source code:<br>
1-1.py (Brute Force approach - Note: this does not work well because counting method is wrong)<br>
1-2.py (Monte Carlo method approach)

How to use:<br>
$python 1-1.py 10<br>
$python 1-2.py <br>

## Q2.What is the standard deviation of your total payment for N=10?

How to provide an answer to the question:<br>
Computational complexity when using brute force is 3628800, i.e., O(10^6), therefore, we can compute directly<br><br>

source code:<br>
1-4.py (Monte Carlo method approach)

How to use:<br>
$python 1-4.py<br>


## Q3.What is the mean of your total payment for N=20?

How to provide an answer to the question:<br>
Computational complexity when using brute force is 2432902008176640000, i.e., O(10^18), therefore ,we cannot compute with brute force method<br><br>

source code:<br>
1-3.py (Monte Carlo method approach) <br>

How to use: <br>
$python 1-3.py <br>

## Q4. What is the standard deviation of your total payment for N=20?

How to provide an answer to the question:<br>
Computational complexity when using brute force is 2432902008176640000, i.e., O(10^18), therefore ,we cannot compute with brute force method<br><br>

source code:<br>
1-5.py (Monte Carlo method approach) <br>

How to use: <br>
$python 1-5.py <br>


## Q5. What is the probability that your total payment is greater than or equal to 45 for N=10?

How to provide an answer to the question:<br>
we can compute sample space and the number of cases where total payment is greater than or equal to 45, therefore, we can gain result from direct computation. (NOTE: I did get my answer in an another way, but this approach also might be good)<br><br>

How to solve:<br>
I just caclculate upper probability when total payment is greater than or equal to 160. I used mean value and standard deviation earned through previous questions for this calculus.<br>


## Q6. What is the probability that your total payment is greater than or equal to 160 for N=20?

How to provide an answer to the question:<br>
1. Infer probability density function
2. Integrate the function and calculate the probability where total payment is greater than or equal to 160.<br>
